# RLDevAlong-2019
Reddit RoguelikeDevAlong 2019 - Python 3.7

This repository is for the /r/RoguelikeDev 2019 DevAlong! I'm using Python 3.7.3 and Notepad++/PyCharm for development, as well as Sphinx for documentation.

Programming has mostly just been my hobby; I know a tiny bit of Java, C++, JavaScript, and GML (GameMaker Language). I've been wanting to learn Python for a while now, and this is the perfect opportunity to do that and create a genuine Roguelike, which is a genre I enjoy quite a bit. I'll also try to research and follow some best practices so I can start developing those habits for future projects.

I'll mainly just be following the tutorial used by the DevAlong, but if inspiration strikes or I want to experiment then that'll happen too!

And it's finally finished! I've successfully followed the tutorial to the end, and nothing is broken. Along the way I've learned a lot about Python, IDE's, best practices, and more. There are a couple more things I want to do with this particular project: namely, I want to integrate Sphinx, as it didn't work before and I put off going down that rabbit hole until after finishing the project. I also want to rewrite the code to get rid of any deprecated functionality. It all still works, but this will give me a concrete end point (all files have been double-checked and converted) as well as more opportunities to poke around TCOD and gain a deeper understanding of the library.

Almost there! Part 12 finished. PyCharm is really paying off.

And Part 11 is in the bank! Everything went smoothly, thanks to my switch to the PyCharm IDE. I wanted to wait until this project was done to switch over, but PyCharm was just too handy! It's sped up the workflow considerably, and Notepad++ can go back to editing .ini files. I added one extra bit: the player heals 1 HP for every turn they wait. Simple, and we'll see how much it breaks the difficulty in Part 12.

Finished part 10! I was expecting some major bugs with the engine.py function rewrites, but aside from a few minor syntax errors it went smoothly. It's very rewarding to have a basic and functional game, if only with one level so far. I'm looking forward to finishing the tutorial.

Finished Part 9! Life has kept me very busy and I've fallen behind schedule. I had to hunt down an obscure bug which was wreaking havoc with my fireball targeting code; turns out it was an errant plus sign (i.e. targeting+cancelled instead of targeting_cancelled). I can see why an IDE that catches syntax errors is so useful.

Finished half of Part 7. My issues last update were caused by a syntax error and a missing Break statement. I've been discovering more and more features of Notepad++ that make development easier, like the Folder as Workspace window, document map, and styles! Switching to Obsidian and adjusting some of the colors really make it feel like a new dev program, and it's much easier on the eyes than blinding white. I'm really enjoying my workflow now; not working through an IDE like PyCharm is really helping me understand how everything actually fits and works together, which was one of my goals going into this DevAlong. My goal now is just to focus on finishing the tutorial, with a secondary goal being to update the code to get rid of all the deprecated functions being used. That will allow me to fiddle with the project on my own and gain a deeper understanding of tcod, which will hopefully lead to other improvements as I gain fluency in Python and these libraries. Exciting stuff!

Part 6 is complete! I have a couple of issues to track down before I move on; namely rendering order and being able to move after death. I've also caught up on docstrings and am now documenting as I go.

No progress done on the actual tutorial, but I've been taking the time to finish my inline comments and start figuring out how to add documentation as I go along. I've been reading some Python style guides and documentation guides, and my current method of inline commenting every single piece of code is apparently overzealous (I can see why). I've uploaded what I've done so far, but now my goal is to go through each file and add the proper Google docstrings so I can eventually build up some documentation via Sphinx. I won't be focusing too much on extensive documentation (oh, the irony) from now on but just the basics so I can get a sense of how Sphinx works.

My next step is to clean up the inline comments, finish adding all the docstrings, and then continue following the tutorial, adding documentation as I go.

I've finished the tutorial through Part 5, and nothing is broken! I didn't really have a grasp on Python beyond very basic Rasberry Pi programming, and as I've progressed with this tutorial code I'm really impressed by how clear and simple Python can be. I know that's one of its strengths, but it's really striking to experience it in person. My current goal is to finish the tutorial series and then start expanding stuff to test out how difficult that would be without the helping hand. I'm sure the r/RoguelikeDev FAQs will be very helpful!
