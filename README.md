Reddit RoguelikeDevAlong 2019 - Python 3.7

This repository is for the /r/RoguelikeDev 2019 DevAlong! I'm using Python and Notepad++ for development.

Programming is just my hobby; I know a tiny bit of Java, C++, JavaScript, and GML (GameMaker Language). I've been wanting to learn Python for a while now, and this is the perfect opportunity to do that and create a geniune Roguelike, which is a genre I enjoy quite a bit.

I'll mainly just be following the tutorial used by the DevAlong, but if inspiration strikes or I want to experiment then that'll happen too!
