# RLDevAlong-2019
Reddit RoguelikeDevAlong 2019 - Python 3.7

This repository is for the /r/RoguelikeDev 2019 DevAlong! I'm using Python and Notepad++ for development.

Programming is just my hobby; I know a tiny bit of Java, C++, JavaScript, and GML (GameMaker Language). I've been wanting to learn Python for a while now, and this is the perfect opportunity to do that and create a geniune Roguelike, which is a genre I enjoy quite a bit.

I'll mainly just be following the tutorial used by the DevAlong, but if inspiration strikes or I want to experiment then that'll happen too!



UPDATE 6/26/2019
I've finished the tutorial through Part 5, and nothing is broken! I didn't really have a grasp on Python beyond very basic Rasberry Pi programming, and as I've progressed with this tutorial code I'm really impressed by how clear and simple Python can be. I know that's one of its strengths, but it's really striking to experience it in person. My current goal is to finish the tutorial series and then start expanding stuff to test out how difficult that would be without the helping hand. I'm sure the r/RoguelikeDev FAQs will be very helpful!
