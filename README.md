# RLDevAlong-2019
Reddit RoguelikeDevAlong 2019 - Python 3.7

This repository is for the /r/RoguelikeDev 2019 DevAlong! I'm using Python 3.7.3 and Notepad++ for development, as well as reStructuredText and Sphinx for documentation.

Programming is just my hobby; I know a tiny bit of Java, C++, JavaScript, and GML (GameMaker Language). I've been wanting to learn Python for a while now, and this is the perfect opportunity to do that and create a geniune Roguelike, which is a genre I enjoy quite a bit. I'll also try to research and follow some best practices so I can start developing those habits for future projects.

I'll mainly just be following the tutorial used by the DevAlong, but if inspiration strikes or I want to experiment then that'll happen too!

No progress done on the actual tutorial, but I've been taking the time to finish my inline comments and start figuring out how to add documentation as I go along. I've been reading some Python style guides and documentation guides, and my current method of inline commenting every single piece of code seems to be overzealous, even to me. I've uploaded what I've done so far, but now my goal is to go through each file and add the proper docstrings so I can build up some documentation via Sphinx. I won't be focusing too much on extensive documentation (oh, the irony) from now on but just the basics so I can get a sense of how reStructuredText and Sphinx work. My next step is to reduce the inline comments the the essentials, finish adding all the docstrings, build the first version of the Sphinx documentation, and then continue following the tutorial, adding documentation as I go.

I've finished the tutorial through Part 5, and nothing is broken! I didn't really have a grasp on Python beyond very basic Rasberry Pi programming, and as I've progressed with this tutorial code I'm really impressed by how clear and simple Python can be. I know that's one of its strengths, but it's really striking to experience it in person. My current goal is to finish the tutorial series and then start expanding stuff to test out how difficult that would be without the helping hand. I'm sure the r/RoguelikeDev FAQs will be very helpful!
